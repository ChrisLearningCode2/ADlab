<h1>Active Directory Home Lab</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
Created a Lab enviorment to set up Active Directory in Virtual Box. Connected other Virtual machines to the Domain Controller.
Also used a power shell script to upload bulk users for training and practice.
While configuring the Lab there were some .dll files missing which needed to be added for the VirtualBox to run. I also had issues with an Error pertaining to Hypervisor conflicts, that I also addredded.
